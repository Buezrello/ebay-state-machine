## Implementation of simple state machines for a job interviews

## How to run
* From the main method.
* Edit the main method if you need to change the input.

## Explanation
* Due to the triviality of the task, I decided not to use ready-made frameworks like Spring Statemachine. In real life, state machines would be implemented based on Camunda.
* Persistence  is implemented in-memory. I didn't want to complicate the project. If necessary, it is very easy to change the persistence using a database (perhaps Redis is enough in this case) or simply save the data to a file.
